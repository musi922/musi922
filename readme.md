## 👋 Hi, I’m Richard Musime

I work in two worlds.

⚡ Modern Web — React, React Native, Next.js, Node.js, Nest.js, JavaScript, TypeScript  
🏢 Enterprise — SAP CAP, SAP UI5, SAP Fiori, SAP RAP, SAP CPI, SAP SAC, SAP BTP, SAP S/4HANA, OData Services  

Most developers pick a side.  
I decided to understand both.

### 🧠 What I Actually Do

- Build modern frontends that people enjoy using  
- Design backend APIs that don’t collapse under pressure  
- Integrate enterprise SAP systems with clean web apps  
- Work with business logic that actually runs companies  
- Fix bugs that “were not there yesterday”  

Yes, I understand `useEffect`.  
Yes, I also understand OData.
